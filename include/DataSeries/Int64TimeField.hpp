/** \brief Special field for dealing with different time representations that 
    have a base type of an int64.
    
    May eventually be extended to deal with
    underlying representations that are int32's.  Currently enforces the
    restriction that all accessed extents have the same units and epoch.
    
    Int64Field is intentionally protected so that you can't get at the
    various base-class operations without doing something special.

    // conversions; it turns out that there are two uses for
    // converting a time: 1) converting the units, for example to
    // calculate the distance between two times (durations), and 2)
    // converting the full epoch to get an absolute time.  Really need
    // to get some non-unix epoch data so we can play with this; only
    // ran into the issues with double time by using it (not enough
